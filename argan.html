        <h2>Argan Hair Oil</h2>
        <h4>WHY WE LOVE IT...</h4>
        <p>Argan oil — or “liquid gold,” as many refer to it — is made from the fresh kernels of the fruit of the argan tree in Morocco. Pure argan oil has been used for centuries for cooking and as a home remedy for health and beauty, including hair loss. Today it can be found in a number of hair and skin care products. Argan oil has been shown to provide several health benefits when applied to the skin and many of those benefits extend to the hair.</p>
