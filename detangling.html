        <h2>Detangling Brush</h2>
        <h4>WHY WE LOVE IT...</h4>
        <p>A detangling brush is a brush that has been specifically designed for hair that gets tangled or knotted easily. This can be common if you have long or very thick hair. Because although all brushes can, to a certain extent, be used to remove knots and tangles, a detangling brush will allow you to do this without tugging or pulling the hair, and therefore minimising the damage.</p>
